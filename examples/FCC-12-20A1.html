I.          INTRODUCTION
         1. Since its inception roughly 30 years ago, the 800 MHz Cellular Radiotelephone (Cellular)
Service has been instrumental in transforming the communications landscape by making mobile services
broadly available to the American public.1 For many years, the Cellular Services licensing model has
helped successfully drive widespread construction and initial service to the public. Today, most Cellular
Service markets are almost completely licensed, with only limited unlicensed Cellular Service area
remaining. At this advanced stage of the Cellular Service, however, the site-based aspect of this licensing
model is yielding diminished returns. As regions have become substantially developed, the significant
administrative burdens on licensees associated with the site-based model no longer appear to be
outweighed by the public benefits produced. In addition, the Cellular Service stands apart from virtually
all other commercial wireless services by not yet transitioning to a geographic-based model, which offers
greater flexibility and reduced regulatory requirements. Thus, consistent with the Commissions
regulatory reform agenda,2 we propose in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the
licensing model for the Cellular Service from a site-based model to a geographic-based approach.
         2. Specifically, we propose to issue geographic-area Overlay Licenses through competitive
bidding, in two stages. Stage I of the transition would include all Cellular Service markets that meet our
proposed Substantially Licensed test. In this Stage, Overlay Licenses would be offered at auction and
site-based licensing would cease in such markets. This is because in markets that have already undergone
substantial buildout, the site-based model is of limited utility. The site-based regime would continue,

 The Cellular service-specific rules are in Part 22, Subpart H. See generally 47 C.F.R. §§ 22.900 et seq. Certain
Part 1 rules, e.g., those found at 47 C.F.R. Part 1, Subpart F, also apply to the Cellular Service.

 See, e.g., Preliminary Plan for Retrospective Analysis of Existing Rules, 2011 WL 5387696 (F.C.C.); Amendment
of Part 101 of the Commissions Rules to Facilitate the Use of Microwave for Wireless Backhaul and Other Uses to
Provide Additional Flexibility to Broadcast Auxiliary Service and Operational Fixed Microwave Licensees, Report
and Order, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and Memorandum Opinion and Order, WT Docket No. 10-
153, RM-11602, 26 FCC Rcd 11614, 11698 (Statement of Chairman Julius Genachowski, noting the Commissions
regulatory reform agenda, recognizing our ongoing commitment to remove or reform outdated regulations).


                                                                             2

however, in all other Cellular Service markets for a defined period until Stage II of the transition. We
propose seven years as the appropriate time period before Stage II is triggered. Our proposal includes
continued protection of incumbents from harmful interference throughout all stages of the transition.
         3. We also propose to streamline the Cellular Service rules, including, for example, updating
application requirements and deleting certain data collection requirements, such as certifications
associated with cessation of the former requirement to provide analog service (analog sunset).
Consistent with our other flexibly licensed services, we propose to establish a signal field strength limit.
We seek comment on all aspects of our proposals, and on the alternative proposals discussed in this
NPRM, including those of CTIA–The Wireless Association (CTIA),3 the National Telecommunications
Cooperative Association (NTCA),4 The Rural Telecommunications Group (RTG),5 and others on the
record.6
        4. In anticipation of potential regulatory changes in the Cellular Service, we adopt the
companion Order, below. With this Order we impose a freeze on the filing of certain Cellular
applications. We also establish interim procedures in the Order regarding currently pending applications.
These prudent steps will help ensure a more efficient and orderly rulemaking, consistent with numerous
prior Commission actions, while allowing continued expansion of service to consumers in many markets.

to two Cellular providers per market (herein, Original System Licensees (OSLs)),9 one on each Block,
without competitive bidding. Every OSL was given the exclusive right, for a five-year period from the
date of grant of the initial construction authorization for that CMA Block, to build out anywhere within
the CMA boundary.10 The area timely built out during that five-year period became the licensees initial
Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA), the licensed area entitled to protection from harmful
interference,11 while any area not built out by the five-year mark (Unserved Area) was automatically
relinquished for re-licensing on a site-by-site basis by the Commission.12 Under site-based licensing, the
applicant requests authorization to construct at a specific transmitter location (or multiple locations) in
Unserved Area,13 and may only construct authorized transmitters. For all CMA Blocks except one
(Chambers, Texas),14 licenses have been issued to OSLs and the initial five-year periods have expired.15
        6. The Commission established two phases for applicants seeking to provide Cellular service in
Unserved Area for each CMA Block: Phase I and Phase II.16 As of late 2007, the Phase I filing window
had ended in all licensed Blocks.17 Under current rules, Phase II lasts indefinitely.18 Phase II applications
specify the area to be licensed and are subject to a 30-day public comment period during which petitions
to deny and mutually exclusive applications may be filed. In the event that mutually exclusive
applications are filed for a particular Unserved Area, they are resolved through competitive bidding in
closed auctions.19 Licenses granted in Phase II are subject to a one-year construction deadline for the

  In this NPRM, we use the terms Original System Licensee and OSL and define them to include also the successors-
in-interest, transferees, and assignees of the actual party that was initially authorized to construct the first Cellular
system on Block A or B in a particular CMA.

15
  By 1990, in some urban markets (MSAs) the initial 5-year period had already ended. The most recently issued
OSLs were the result of Auction 45 for the following 3 RSAs (see 47 C.F.R. § 22.969): 332A (Polk, AR); 582A
(Barnes, ND); and 727A (Ceiba, PR). Their initial 5-year construction periods expired in September 2007.
16
     See 47 C.F.R. § 22.949.
17
   Following each OSLs 5-year build-out period, a 1-day Phase I filing window was opened and closed according to
a specified timetable. See 47 C.F.R. § 22.949(a). See Amendment of Part 22 of the Commissions Rules to Provide
for Filing and Processing of Applications for Unserved Areas in the Cellular Service and to Modify Other Cellular
Rules, Second Report and Order, CC Docket No. 90-6, 7 FCC Rcd 2449, 2457-58 (1992) (1992 Cellular Second
R&O) (providing more information about how Phase I filing windows were set and Phase I applications processed).
The Phase II Unserved Area application period commenced thereafter (with specific timing dependent on the Phase
I process for that particular CMA Block). See 47 C.F.R. § 22.949(b). See also infra Section III.A.2. regarding
Block A of the Chambers, TX CMA (explaining why a Phase I window has never been opened for this Block).
18
  See 47 C.F.R. § 22.949(b). A minimum coverage requirement of 50 contiguous square miles applies to all
applications for Unserved Area, unless submitted by a licensee that wishes to expand its existing Cellular system
using Unserved Area. See 47 C.F.R. § 22.951.

authorized site and the licensee must be providing service to subscribers by the end of the one-year
period;20 failure to build out results in automatic termination of the authorization for that site, and the
Unserved Area again is subject to the filing of site-based applications.21
         7. Both OSLs22 and Unserved Area Licensees23 have used the application process for licenses
to construct in Unserved Area extensively over the years, as shown by the data presented in Section III
below. Cellular licensees have obtained their authorizations primarily through direct application to the
Commission without competitive bidding, as there have rarely been competing, mutually exclusive
applications.24 In the vast majority of markets, both OSLs and Unserved Area Licensees have had 15 to
20 years (even more in some cases) in which to build or expand their systems through site-based
licensing,25 while in most other markets the Unserved Area application process has been available to
interested persons for over 10 years. As discussed in Section III below, based on our data, only limited
Unserved Area remains outside of Alaska and certain rural markets in the western United States.
         8. In contrast to site-based licensing, geographic-based licensing generally authorizes
construction anywhere within a particular geographic areas boundary (subject to certain interference
protection and other technical requirements) and does not entail applications for prior Commission
approval of specific transmitter locations. In other competing commercial wireless services, the
Commission implemented geographic-based licensing, rather than a site-based model, from the inception
of the radio service, particularly in the Broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS),26 the
Advanced Wireless Service (AWS),27 and the 700 MHz Service.28 In these radio services, the existing
incumbents (e.g., microwave, government, and broadcasters) were to be relocated. In other commercial

     See 47 C.F.R. § 22.949(b).
22
  The existing rules permit OSLs to submit Unserved Area applications to modify their systems following their
initial 5-year build-out periods, subject to the same 1-year build-out requirement as any other applicant for Unserved
Area. See 47 C.F.R. §§ 22.946, 22.949.
23
  We use the term Unserved Area Licensee to mean a licensee that has established a Cellular system in a
particular market solely through the Unserved Area application process – Phase I and/or Phase II – after the
expiration of the OSLs 5-year initial build-out period. As noted above, OSLs also use the Unserved Area
application process to modify their systems.
24
   United States Cellular Corporation, for example, states that it filed 54 Unserved Area applications in the 9 years
before filing comments in this proceeding, and not one was met by a competing application. See USCC Comments
filed Feb. 23, 2009 at 3. Commnet Wireless, LLC similarly states that its applications have rarely been challenged
by a mutually exclusive application. See Commnet Comments filed Feb. 23, 2009 at 13.
25
  By July 1989, the initial filing period for all MSAs (not RSAs) had essentially been completed, and for some
MSAs, the initial 5-year period was already nearing its end. See, e.g., Amendment of the Commissions Rules for

wireless services where incumbents were originally licensed on a site-by-site basis but were permitted to
remain in the band, the Commission also chose to transition to geographic-based overlay licensing
including, for example, the 800 MHz Service,29 the 220 MHz service,30 and the 929-931 MHz Paging
Services.31 In each instance, the Commission determined that the geographic-area licensing model
afforded licensees increased flexibility to construct and operate facilities within a larger geographic area
and commence operations without prior Commission approval, thereby reducing regulatory burdens.
           B.       CTIA Proposals and Industry Comments on the Record
        9. In October 2008, CTIA filed a Petition requesting that the Commission change Cellular
licensing from a site-based regime to a geographic area-based regime in all markets and to assign to
incumbents, without using competitive bidding, all remaining Unserved Area.32 In response to the Public
Notice seeking comment on CTIAs Petition,33 10 parties filed comments,34 six (including CTIA) filed
reply comments,35 and two (including CTIA) filed ex parte letters.36 In September 2010, CTIA submitted
a revised proposal (CTIA Revised Plan) which it asserts takes into account the objectives and concerns
raised by commenters in this proceeding.37 Thus far, only RTG has filed comments specifically
addressing the CTIA Revised Plan.38 In May 2011, CTIA, GCI Communication Corp. (GCI), NTCA, and
RTG met with Commission staff to express their additional views regarding transition approaches for
Cellular licensing and, accordingly, filed ex parte letters.39 Subsequently, CTIA, AT&T, Inc. (AT&T)
and Verizon Wireless met with Commission staff to express their additional views regarding transition
approaches for Cellular licensing and CTIA filed ex parte letters accordingly.40

         10. CTIA argues that the existing site-based rules are antiquated and administratively
burdensome41 for both licensees and FCC staff because the rules require the filing of an application every
time a licensee seeks to make even a minor system modification.42 For example, under the current
licensing paradigm, a Cellular licensee making any system change that would expand or decrease its
CGSA must file an application with comprehensive engineering data and technical exhibits, and for
CGSA expansions, no matter how small, must receive Commission approval prior to commencing
operations.43 CTIA explains that Cellular site-based licensing has remained a unique anomaly, as
competing commercial wireless services are licensed based on market areas rather than transmitter sites.44
In CTIAs view, site-based licensing is no longer necessary to encourage build-out in markets with
minimal remaining Unserved Area and actually hampers the ability of licensees to expand and provide
additional coverage.45 CTIA states that site-based licensing requires constant updating and revision,
imposes significant costs on licensees, and is based upon an analog technical model with little
relationship to the current deployment of digital services to the public.46
         11. In its Revised Plan, CTIA requests that the Commission change the Cellular Service to
geographic area-based licensing and terminate site-based access to Unserved Area in each CMA Block
that is Fully Served. CTIA defines a Fully Served Block as one where either: (1) 90% of the total land
area is served; or (2) there is no parcel of Unserved Area measuring at least 50 contiguous square miles.47
Under both prongs, CTIA proposes to exclude government lands, but not tribal areas.48 All Unserved
Area in Fully Served Blocks would be assigned to existing incumbents on a proportional basis without
the use of competitive bidding.49 CTIA does not propose performance requirements regarding these
areas. CTIA estimates that 91% of all Blocks meet its 90% served test.50 So long as a CMA Block is
under-served (i.e., not Fully Served), CTIA proposes that it remain under site-based licensing rules.51
            12. CTIAs Revised Plan entails the establishment of fixed license boundaries for all incumbents

in all CMA Blocks based on existing CGSAs, to be documented by certain specified submissions.52
Disputes over existing CGSA boundaries and the distribution of the remaining Unserved Area to
incumbents would, under CTIAs Revised Plan, need to be resolved through cooperation among licensees
and in the event that such cooperative efforts fail, by referral to arbitration at the expense of the referring
party.53 Once fixed boundaries were established, licensees would be permitted to add and modify
transmitter sites within those boundaries without applications or notification, subject to a 40 dBuV/m
median field strength limit,54 as first proposed by Verizon Wireless.55 In non-Fully Served Blocks,
licensees wishing to expand beyond their established fixed boundaries would need to submit a major
modification application for Unserved Area, as under current rules.56
         13. In support of CTIAs Petition, AT&T asserts, among other things, that changing from analog
to digital operations has rendered site-based Cellular licensing obsolete, unnecessarily burdensome, and
inefficient and that geographic-area licensing will create regulatory parity among competing services.57
Verizon Wireless also generally endorses the CTIA Petition58 but makes various additional proposals,
including: (1) a staggered transition process based on regional groupings of CMA Blocks; (2) the
provision of public notice of, and opportunity to comment on, claimed licensed area boundaries (i.e.,
existing CGSAs, including CGSA extensions into adjacent CMAs); and (3) a plan for informal dispute
resolution of boundary claims (more detailed than in CTIAs Petition), in which a de minimis discrepancy
standard would be applied.59
        14. In contrast, commenters representing the interests of smaller and rural providers60 generally
favor indefinite retention of the current site-based licensing regime.61 RTG, for example, continues to
believe that there should be no sunset of this licensing model, as rural carriers still file site-based
applications to serve remote areas or areas with low population density.62 NTCA, the Rural

Independent Competitive Alliance (RICA), Commnet Wireless, LLC (Commnet), and GCI essentially
agree.63 NTCA also claims that its members are asked by their communities to ensure that hikers,
hunters, and others enjoying the most rural territory can complete a call in an emergency.64 Commnet
continues to send technicians to Unserved Area to determine if there is demand for service and claims that
with most of its Unserved Area applications, the OSL could have applied for that spectrum over at least
sixteen years but did not do so.65 GCI, which operates in Alaska, urges continuation of site-based
licensing and is concerned it will be unable to improve (or even maintain) its network if the Commission
adopts CTIAs proposal.66 RTG also criticizes CTIAs Revised Plan by asserting that it provides no
incentive to serve areas obtained through the proposed proportional allotment and that its definition of
Fully Served could leave large areas . . . without service indefinitely.67
         15. Comments by smaller and more rural providers largely reject CTIAs statistics. According to
RTG, for example, CTIAs Petition misleadingly undercounts actual use of the [site-based licensing]
process by reporting only grants, not filings, and only new applications, not modification applications.68
RICA, GCI, and NTCA make similar arguments.69 Several of these commenters are also skeptical of
CTIAs proposed mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise between adjacent licensees
concerning license boundaries.70 United States Cellular Corporation (USCC), a mid-sized non-rural
carrier, argues that a voluntary consultation process is unworkable for dispute resolution without legal
standards.71
       16. USCC generally favors the existing regime but states that issuance of a CMA-based license
may be appropriate in limited circumstances. Such circumstances might include where the existing

incumbents CGSA already encompasses virtually the entire market or where no one other than an OSL
has sought and obtained a [site-based] license during the eighteen years such licenses have been
available.72 USCC argues that site-based licensing should be retained, however, at least in any market
with at least one Unserved Area Licensee, so that OSLs and Unserved Area Licensees have equal
opportunity to expand their systems.73
          17. While preferring retention of the existing paradigm, some rural commenters state that they
could accept, in the alternative, a limited transition to geographic-area licensing. Their suggestions,
however, are not highly detailed. GCI, for example, indicates support for issuance of a CMA-based
license if the CGSA is coterminous with the CMA boundary or if Unserved Area in the CMA Block is
less than 50 square miles but does not specify how the small areas would be licensed.74 NTCA suggests
that, if an incumbents actual service area is not coterminous with the CMA Block boundary, or if there
is an Unserved Area parcel that is 50 square miles or larger, the Commission could establish a geographic
license but based only on the territory actually served by the licensee.75 RTG states that Cellular
licensees could elect . . . to transition to some form of market-based licensing, but only where the new
market-based license would encompass the areas they actually serve.76 In response to these alternative
ideas, Verizon Wireless states that preserving site-based licensing should be limited to areas greater than
50 square miles, with smaller areas added to the new market-based license area of the OSL, while
AT&T merely states that it is open to mechanisms to address Unserved Area in the new Cellular
licensing scheme.77
        18. Commenters differ on the issue of how to assign geographic area licenses. MetroPCS
Communications, Inc. (MetroPCS) advocates a transition to geographic-area licensing via auction.78 In
response, USCC argues that an auction is unnecessary in light of the existing normal closed auction
process for mutually exclusive Unserved Area applications.79 AT&T states broadly that, for CMA Blocks
with over 50 contiguous square miles of Unserved Area, the Commission should license that area
through an auction or some other process.80 Subsequently in early 2012, CTIA, AT&T and Verizon

applications. Id. at 4.

Wireless met with Commission staff, and CTIA filed Ex Parte letters accordingly. These letters state that
CTIA, AT&T and Verizon Wireless have concerns with a proposal that would apply an overlay auction
mechanism, possibly implemented as part of a transition from site-based to geographic licensing, for use
in areas that are not substantially served, without explaining the nature of the concerns.81 Commnet does
not advocate a transition via auction, but emphasizes that the Commission used competitive bidding in
prior transitions to geographic area licensing.82 All other commenters are silent on using an auction for a
Cellular licensing transition.83
III.       NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING
         19. This NPRM proposes to eliminate burdensome and time-consuming regulatory processes and
to provide licensees with more flexibility to build out and provide service in areas that are currently
unlicensed in the Cellular Service. Based on the record, it appears that site-based licensing may unduly
limit licensees ability in many markets to adapt to technological and marketplace changes, which
burdens licensees and consumes FCC staff resources, as application filings are required for even minor
technical system changes. These problems can be addressed by moving to a geographic-based model,
which would bring the Cellular Service into greater harmony with the more flexible licensing schemes
used successfully by other similar mobile services, such as PCS,84 the 700 MHz Service,85 and AWS.86
At the same time, we propose to preserve direct access to Unserved Area through the existing site-based
application process for an appropriate period in Cellular Service markets that are less substantially built
out.
        20. The current site-based licensing model has proven successful over time, as the Cellular
Service has achieved widespread construction and service to the public. In anticipation of releasing this
NPRM, the Commission has undertaken the task of digitizing87 all existing CGSAs based on maps
accompanying Cellular applications.88 It is clear from our data that the vast majority of CMA Blocks
already are substantially built out. Licensees in these markets – which we term Substantially Licensed

  Using specialized computer software, we created a data set (a discrete set of points along each CGSA boundary)
using the CGSA maps on file. These data sets are stored electronically and can be used to generate digital
representations of the CGSA maps. They can also be used to calculate Unserved Area and licensed area within a
particular CMA Block, and to capture other geographical characteristics of the area of interest.
88
  The maps provided at Appendix B summarize our preliminary data. One map shows Unserved Area throughout
the continental United States, and the other shows Unserved Area in Alaska. Additional graphics and data are
discussed below in Section III.A, B. See also http://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/12-40.

as set forth in Section III.A.1. below – have faced increasing regulatory challenges, however. Among
other things, they do not have the ability to modify and expand their systems without Commission filings,
and must seek prior Commission approval through filings if the CGSA would be expanded, even for
minor adjustments to their systems. We believe that it would serve the public interest to reduce
administrative burdens for these licensees (as well as for Commission staff) by providing Cellular
licensees in such markets with greater flexibility to modify their operations to respond more quickly to
market conditions. Moreover, the Commission has long held that market-based licensing regimes are
simpler to administer for all parties.89
         21. We recognize that, with direct access to Unserved Area through site-based licensing,
licensees and prospective new entrants are free to respond to market changes by filing an application on
an as-needed basis (for a filing fee) without use of competitive bidding in most cases.90 We believe that
there are public interest benefits of preserving such direct access by all interested parties for any Unserved
Area in CMA Blocks that are less substantially built out (i.e., not Substantially Licensed under our
proposed test). While site-based application filings would continue to be required for some period going
forward in these markets, there is a significantly smaller volume of system modification filings in areas
that are less built out.
         22. Additionally, in developing a new model aimed at transitioning the Cellular Service to a
geographic-based model, we must keep in mind long-held Commission policies governing spectrum
assignment. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) revised the Commissions auction authority by
substantially amending sections 309(j)(1) and (2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended
(Act).91 Under section 309(j)(1),92 with limited exceptions that are not applicable here, the Commission is
required to license spectrum through competitive bidding whenever it accepts mutually exclusive
applications93 for initial licenses or permits.94 Consistent with the Commissions policy that competitive

bidding places licenses in the hands of those that value the spectrum most highly,95 we believe that it
would be in the public interest to adopt the transition described below, which allows the filing of mutually
exclusive applications that would be resolved through competitive bidding.
         23. In light of the above-described goals and considerations, we propose to issue CMA-based
Overlay Licenses for each Block via Stage I and Stage II auctions, thus making immediately available to
the Overlay Licensee, for primary service, all Unserved Area remaining in the particular Block as of an
established cut-off date.96 An overlay license is issued for the entire geographic area (in this case, the
entire CMA Block), but requires the overlay licensee to provide interference protection to incumbent
operations (in this case, Cellular Service incumbents CGSAs existing as of a certain cut-off date).
         24. In Stage I of the transition, we would offer Overlay Licenses only for those CMA Blocks that
either: (1) as of a certain cut-off date, are Substantially Licensed pursuant to certain benchmarks; or (2)
have Cellular service that has been authorized solely under interim operating authority (IOA) (i.e., for
which no primary license has been issued). The specific benchmarks we propose to apply in determining
whether a market is in the Substantially Licensed category, and the underlying data supporting our
proposal, are discussed below in Section III.A.1. All other Blocks would remain subject to the existing
Unserved Area licensing system until a future date, when we would implement Stage II of the transition
and offer Overlay Licenses for these remaining CMA Blocks. We seek comment, as discussed further
below, on whether seven years is the appropriate timeframe before initiation of Stage II. Our proposal is
discussed in more detail below, in Sections III.A. and B. We seek comment on all aspects of our
proposal.
         25. We invite comment as well on the expected costs and benefits (to the extent applicable) of
operating under our proposal. For example, would the resulting lack of data that would otherwise be
collected and available to the public through the Commissions Universal Licensing System and other
databases (i.e., data that is currently available regarding major and minor CGSA modification
applications, grants, construction notifications, etc., indicating the location of Cellular Service transmitter
sites) constitute a detrimental cost? If so, to what extent? Would the cost be outweighed by the benefits
associated with the reduction in regulatory burdens, paperwork, and other aspects of our proposal? By
reducing the filing burdens on many Cellular providers, we would expect resulting lower costs for the
providers, and in turn, we would expect such lower costs to have a positive effect on service to
subscribers.97 We seek comment on these cost considerations, including quantification of expected
savings (in terms of monetary and human resources, for example) resulting from no longer having to
submit certain applications once fixed boundaries have been established. We also seek comment on the
extent to which expected savings might be passed on to subscribers. We hope these proposals will also
promote enhanced competitive options for consumers and we seek comment on any additional steps the
Commission could take, in this proceeding, to promote this policy priority.
        26. For reasons explained below, we propose to exempt the Gulf of Mexico Service Area
(GMSA) from the transition. In addition, based on certain industry proposals on the record, discussed
above, we propose to establish a signal field strength limit for all Cellular licensees in all CMA Blocks.

Initiative,98 we also take this opportunity to propose additional changes to certain Cellular rules in Parts 1
and Part 22, including updates to provisions such as those governing application requirements, removal of
provisions that we consider outdated going forward,99 and ministerial corrections. Finally, we seek
comment on whether to move the Part 22 Cellular rules, as well as the Part 24 rules, to Part 27.
           A.       Stage I Transition
                    1.          Substantially Licensed CMA Blocks
         27. We propose to treat a CMA Block as Substantially Licensed if either of the following
benchmarks is met: (1) at least 95% of the total land area is licensed; or (2) there is no unlicensed parcel
within the Block at least 50 contiguous square miles in size.100 An analysis of Cellular licensed area by
Block reflects that only 20% of the 1,468 CMA Blocks are geographically licensed between less than
10% up to roughly 94%. The vast majority of all Blocks (approximately 80%) fall at or above the 95%
licensed threshold, representing in our view a logical breaking point for inclusion in Stage I of the
proposed transition.101 We also recognize, however, that a Block that has less than 95% of its total land
area licensed might not have sufficient size parcels of Unserved Area to warrant exclusion from transition
in Stage I. Our current rules prohibit a new entrant from applying to serve an area smaller than 50
contiguous square miles.102 We therefore propose that a Block be deemed Substantially Licensed if it
does not have even one remaining unlicensed parcel that is at least 50 contiguous square miles in size,
regardless of the percentage of licensed area.103
        28. We list the Blocks that meet our proposed test in Appendix C. Specifically, 601 of the 734
Block A markets appear to meet the proposed test, and 596 of the 734 Block B markets appear to meet the
proposed test, for a total of 1,197 of 1,468 Blocks.104 We also depict our preliminary data in two
additional maps provided in Appendix D.105 These maps illustrate, for each Block, which markets appear
to meet the proposed test and which markets, while served, do not.106
       29. We propose to include total land area without exclusions in our calculation of licensed area
and Unserved Area. This contrasts with the Commissions approach in the 700 MHz Service, where

   None of the CMA Blocks in Alaska currently meets our proposed test under either benchmark, and therefore no
Alaskan Blocks are currently included in Appendix C.

?                                      Federal Communications Commission                               FCC 12-20


certain 700 MHz Service licensees were permitted to exclude government lands from coverage
calculation for purposes of compliance with prospective build-out requirements. In the 700 MHz
proceeding, the Commission noted the frequent difficulty of, or specific prohibitions barring, in some
instances (e.g., a military base), site access to government lands.107 We propose to treat government lands
differently in this Cellular Service transition for two reasons. First, the 700 MHz Service government
lands exclusion was adopted in conjunction with the imposition of aggressive construction benchmarks,
which for the first time included mandatory coverage of geography (rather than population). In our
proposed Cellular Service transition, the calculation is not based on a consideration of compliance with
future construction benchmarks but is solely for purposes of determining whether a CMA Block meets
our test for inclusion in Stage I. Second, in our analysis of digitized CGSAs, we observed that Cellular
licensees have frequently applied to provide service to federal lands, as the demand for Cellular service
has increased in areas such as national parks.108 We believe that permitting the exclusion of lands that are
already being served as part of a Cellular licensees CGSA would provide inaccurate results as to what
areas are in fact Substantially Licensed for purposes of inclusion in the appropriate transition stage.
        30. Through our proposed transition, an Overlay Licensee would not only have the flexibility to
extend service into currently Unserved Area, but also would be able to do so without filing modification
applications, with limited exceptions.109 In addition, in the event that all or a portion of an incumbents
CGSA is relinquished by that incumbent (e.g., through license cancellation, reduction in CGSA,
permanent discontinuance of operations, or failure to renew a license), the Overlay Licensee of that CMA
Block would no longer be required to protect the relinquished area and could immediately provide service
on a primary basis in that area.110 We believe that auctioning only the remaining Unserved Area in a
particular Block without overlay licensing rights could result in incumbents relinquished areas being held
in the Commissions auction inventory and only accessible via a future auction. Our Overlay License
proposal will facilitate prompt service to such areas through reduced administrative burdens.
         31. Under our proposal, just as incumbents that do not become Overlay Licensees would be
assured continued protection from harmful interference within their existing CGSA footprint, they would
in turn be obligated to protect the Overlay Licensees from harmful interference. Non-Overlay licensees
CGSA boundaries would be permanently fixed, insofar as such licensees would not be permitted to
expand their CGSAs in Blocks included in the auction, except through contractual arrangements with
other licensees. To foster secondary market transactions, we propose to continue to allow licensees to
partition their CGSAs and/or disaggregate their authorized spectrum, as well as enter into leasing
arrangements, as under our current rules.111 We seek comment on this proposal. Non-Overlay licensees
will also be free to modify their systems in response to market demands without Commission filings, so

long as the CGSA would not be expanded (other than through contractual arrangements) or reduced as a
result, and subject to any obligations imposed on all licensees.112
        32. We recognize that in Substantially Licensed markets included in our Stage I transition, the
new Overlay Licenses awarded in the auction will be heavily encumbered by the incumbents, whose
CGSAs would continue to be entitled to protection from harmful interference. A prospective Overlay
Licensee would therefore need to be familiar with incumbent operations and should take care to
understand how such operations may affect its ability to execute its business plan.113 Under delegated
authority, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) will determine, prior to conducting the
auctions, what procedures (if any) are warranted to resolve discrepancies and other anomalies in the
licensing data in order to establish definitive boundaries of existing authorized CGSAs as of certain cut-
off dates. The Bureau will also issue the appropriate Public Notice(s) regarding such procedures. We
recognize that, in some Blocks, the remaining Unserved Area as of the auction date may be very small,
fragmented, and/or not immediately servable.
                   2.      Interim Operating Authority Block (Chambers, Texas, Block A – CMA
                           672A)
         33. Chambers, Texas (CMA 672A) is the only Block for which a Cellular license has never been
issued.114 AT&T Mobility of Galveston LLC (AT&T Galveston) holds an interim operating authorization
and provides Cellular service to nearly all of the area in this Block under Call Sign KNKP971.115
Notably, neither AT&T nor any other commenter has mentioned this unlicensed market thus far in this
proceeding. We propose that Chambers be licensed on a geographic area (CMA Block) basis and that it
be included in Stage I described above.
         34. We propose not to apply our existing rules concerning the various build-out and application
phases that have been applicable to other Cellular markets. For example, we propose not to subject
Chambers to the Phase I or Phase II licensing processes (and because Phase I has terminated for all other
CMA Blocks, we are proposing to delete the provisions that address Phase I applications, and references
thereto, throughout the Part 22 Subpart H rules and applicable Part 1 rules).116 We also propose not to

apply to Chambers the five-year build-out period that is described in section 22.947117 (and because it has
expired for all other CMA Blocks, we are proposing to delete the provisions that address the five-year
period, and references thereto, throughout the Part 22 Subpart H rules and applicable Part 1 rules).118
Consistent with our treatment of newly authorized markets in the 700 MHz proceeding, we propose that
the Overlay License for Chambers will terminate automatically if the licensee fails to provide signal
coverage and offer service over at least 35% of the geographic area of its license authorization within four
years of initial license grant and to at least 70% of the geographic area of its license authorization by the
end of the license term.119 We further propose that, after the build-out requirement has been met, the
Chambers Overlay Licensee should be subject to the same rules and obligations that we apply to those
that are awarded the Overlay Licenses for all Substantially Licensed Blocks.120 AT&T Galveston does
not have primary authority to operate and would not be afforded incumbent status with respect to any
Overlay Licensee resulting from our proposed competitive bidding process.
         35. We believe this proposal provides the most efficient and effective means to foster the
provision of additional advanced wireless service by a primary licensee to this Texas market. We also
believe that our proposed performance obligations are appropriate given the increased regulatory
flexibility afforded any Chambers Overlay Licensee under our transition proposal, including the ability to
modify system parameters and expand service without application filings in most instances. In short, we
believe that our proposal serves the public interest, and we seek comment on all aspects of the proposal,
including any foreseeable costs. Commenters that oppose our proposed approach for Chambers should
offer a detailed alternative proposal that is consistent with the goals of this proceeding and the
Commissions policies as set forth herein, as well as an analysis of the costs and benefits of the alternative
proposal.
           B.      Stage II Transition
         36. As stated above, based on our preliminary data, approximately 20% of all CMA Blocks
currently do not meet either of the two benchmarks of our proposed Substantially Licensed test. We
believe that the public interest is best served by retaining the existing site-based licensing scheme in these
Blocks—primarily Alaska and rural areas out west— to preserve direct access to such area through the
Commissions Unserved Area application process during a defined transition period. The reduction in
administrative burdens identified above for Stage I markets is substantially smaller for these Blocks that
are less built out and have relatively more Unserved Area remaining. In rural areas, service tends to
become economically feasible gradually, and modification and new-system applications are filed to a
much lesser extent than modification applications in the Blocks that are already substantially built out.
This will allow all interested parties, including new entrants, the opportunity to identify the specific areas
they wish to serve as service becomes economically feasible in such markets due to changing
demographics, technologies, or other factors. Under our current site-based rules, the one-year
construction requirement will ensure prompt build-out of areas in these Blocks where licensees seek
authorization to provide service.

commenced.

      See Appendix E.
119
    See 47 C.F.R. § 27.14 (setting forth construction requirements and renewal criteria for, inter alia, 700 MHz
licensees). In the case of automatic license termination, the Chambers license would be returned to the
Commissions auction inventory for re-licensing.
120
   See, e.g., infra Section III.C. (seeking comment on whether to impose any performance benchmarks or other
requirements for Overlay Licenses).

         37. We recognize the public interest benefits of having all CMA Blocks under a single
geographic area licensing scheme, and therefore we propose to retain the site-based licensing model for a
defined period. Specifically, we propose to continue this model for a period of seven years from the date
on which revised Cellular Service rules take effect in this proceeding (Effective Date). We seek comment
on our Stage II proposal and specifically on our proposed seven-year transitional time period. While we
wish to effectuate prompt build-out in the CMA Blocks that do not currently meet the Substantially
Licensed test, we recognize that certain markets may present increased challenges to widespread
deployment in the near term. We seek comment on whether seven years is the appropriate timeframe that
takes into account the goal of ensuring prompt build-out of systems and economic forces that might delay
deployment in certain markets or any alternate proposals commenters may have.121 We also ask that
commenters address the costs and benefits of a seven-year transition period, or for any alternate proposals
set forth.
         38. Possible Exception for Alaska. It is likely to be many years before the Alaskan CMA Blocks
are substantially built out. We seek comment on whether we should simply retain the status quo site-
based scheme for Alaska indefinitely, rather than including it with other Blocks in Stage II. Even if we
include Alaska in the proposed transition in Stage II, we seek comment on whether it is appropriate to
revise the one-year build-out requirement for Alaska so long as it remains subject to site-based licensing.
In addressing these issues, we also seek feedback on the costs and benefits of including Alaska in the
Stage II transition, as well as revision to the one-year build-out requirement.
         39. Possible Other Exceptions. We seek comment on whether public interest considerations
warrant any exception that we have not considered, e.g., an especially challenging rural market that might
require, for example, an extended build-out period, or another kind of exception altogether. Commenters
proposing an exception should include details and supporting rationale consistent with the goals of this
proceeding and the Commissions policies as set forth herein.
           C.       Performance Requirements
         40. We are mindful of our statutory obligation and overarching policy goal of ensuring that the
spectrum is used effectively and efficiently to provide valuable services to the American public, including
those residing in rural areas, and that the spectrum not be warehoused when it could be deployed using
new technologies and services. We also recognize that the Cellular Service has, in most CMAs across the
country, already resulted in significant levels of system deployment during the past few decades. Indeed,
the level of build-out far exceeds even the most stringent geographic-based construction benchmarks the
Commission has imposed on any wireless service to foster public interest goals. In the area not
Substantially Licensed – 20% of the CMA Blocks – the current level of build-out varies significantly, as
discussed above, with most above 70% geographic coverage, and a few below 10% geographic coverage
(e.g., certain Alaskan CMA Blocks), with the rest somewhere in between.122
         41. We seek comment on whether we should adopt any performance benchmarks for Overlay
Licenses to promote build-out in areas covered by these licenses where spectrum is unused and the costs
and benefits of doing so. If we decide to adopt performance benchmarks, what would the measures be?
Should certain categories of CMA Blocks be subject to different benchmarks given varying levels of
deployment among the different CMA Blocks across the country? For instance, should they differ with
respect to the CMA Blocks included in Stage I, where almost all of the CMA Block has been built out,
compared to Stage II, where there is less build-out and more variance among the Blocks? Would it be
appropriate to establish build-out requirements that vary depending on the amount of Unserved Area

remaining, or for CMA Blocks that face particular construction challenges (e.g., Alaska)? If so, what
should those varying requirements be, and on what basis would the requirements apply to specific Blocks,
and what would be the costs and benefits of the variation? Would varying requirements be unduly
cumbersome? In seeking comment, we note that the Commission has never established performance
requirements in similar services mandating 100% build-out of all areas or population centers in a
geographic-based license.
        42. We also seek comment on whether, in place of or in addition to performance build-out
requirements, we should require an Overlay Licensee to make unused spectrum available in the secondary
market to entities that have need for it. Our goal in adopting any such requirement would be to help
ensure that spectrum does not lie fallow where there is real demand for its use. In exploring such an
approach, we recognize that there could be valid reasons why spectrum may remain unused. We also
note that, under our existing secondary market policies and rules, many entities have successfully used
secondary market transactions—including spectrum leasing, partitioning, and disaggregation—to transfer
spectrum usage rights to entities that then employ the previously unused spectrum in providing new
services to the American public. At the same time, we recognize there may be situations in which
secondary market transactions involving unused spectrum do not occur. Accordingly, we take the
opportunity in this proceeding to inquire whether there is more that the Commission should do to promote
secondary market solutions where spectrum held by the Overlay Licensee continues to be unused.
         43. Specifically, we request comment on various possible approaches for facilitating secondary
market transactions for use of spectrum that the Overlay Licensee is not using or may not be inclined to
use. As one possible approach, we seek comment on whether Overlay Licensees that continue to hold
unused spectrum after a certain period of time should be required to make that information publicly
available, in some readily accessible and transparent fashion, so that any party interested in using that
spectrum can more easily seek to take advantage of the opportunity to gain access to the spectrum. Might
such an approach be helpful in promoting productive use of this spectrum? If so, what specific
information (e.g., location and identification of the unused spectrum, point of contact, initial price
offering) would be most useful to stimulating secondary market transactions? At what point after issuing
the Overlay License should the licensee be required to make such information available? Should the
licensee be required to provide such information even if it already has built out some specified portion of
the Overlay License area? If we were to require the licensee to provide information on unused spectrum,
how should this information be made publicly available so that appropriate information is readily
accessible and transparent for potentially interested parties? Should the licensee, for instance, be required
to make this information available to the Commission, which could then post the information for
potentially interested parties? Can such an approach be designed in a way that would serve to reveal the
value of unused spectrum to existing licensees and promote the transfer of usage rights to other parties
that value it more highly and would use it to provide services to the American public? We also seek
comment on the possible costs and benefits of pursuing this secondary market transparency approach.
         44. As another possible approach, should Overlay Licensees be required to participate in good
faith negotiations with a party expressing an interest in spectrum leasing, partitioning, or disaggregating
spectrum in a CMA Block? If so, what specific good faith negotiation processes should we require, and
what is the appropriate timeframe for application of such an access model?123 Or, should we consider a

omitted) (discussing at length various possible performance requirements). In the March, 2011 Native Nations

licenses cover Tribal Land areas. See Improving Communications Services for Native Nations by Promoting

modified version of negotiation methodologies employed in other wireless services, possibly involving
phases of voluntary negotiations, followed by mandatory negotiations?124 What are the relative benefits
and costs to such an approach in the context of Overlay Licenses?
        45. In considering various approaches, we request that commenters address any difficulties they
may have experienced when seeking to access unused spectrum in secondary markets transactions that
could inform our decision-making and could improve the workings of secondary markets with respect to
unused spectrum associated with Overlay Licenses. Finally, we seek comment on any other approach that
commenters may suggest that could facilitate secondary market transactions that help ensure that valuable
spectrum resources do not needlessly lie fallow.
           D.          Competitive Bidding Procedures
         46. As stated above, consistent with the Commissions approach in prior transitions of other
services from site-based to geographic area-based overlay licensing,125 we believe that it serves the public
interest to accept competing, mutually exclusive applications in our proposed transition of Cellular
licensing that will be resolved by competitive bidding.126 We reiterate that we are interested in reducing
regulatory burdens and affording increased system flexibility (including deployment of broadband
service) within fixed boundaries for Cellular licensees, but in a manner that is consistent with
Commission precedent and spectrum management policies. No commenter has offered a justification for
departing from a transition approach under which we accept mutually exclusive applications.
Competitive bidding should place Cellular Overlay Licenses in the hands of those that value them most.
         47. In the event we adopt our proposal for a transition entailing competitive bidding, we propose
to apply the general competitive bidding rules set forth in Part 1, Subpart Q of the Commissions rules,
substantially consistent with the bidding procedures that have been employed in previous auctions.
Specifically, we propose to employ the Part 1 rules governing competitive bidding design, designated
entity preferences, unjust enrichment, application and payment procedures, reporting requirements, and
the prohibition on certain communications between auction applicants.127 Under this proposal, such rules
would be subject to any modifications that the Commission may adopt in the future.128 In addition,
consistent with our long-standing approach, auction-specific matters such as the competitive bidding
design and mechanisms, as well as minimum opening bids and/or reserve prices, would be determined by

request comment on whether any of our Part 1 competitive bidding rules or other auction procedures
would be inappropriate or should be modified for an auction of Cellular licenses in the context of this
proceeding.
         48. Provisions for Designated Entities. In authorizing the Commission to use competitive
bidding, Congress mandated that the Commission ensure that small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity
to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.130 In addition, section 309(j)(3)(B) of the Act
provides that, in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies, the Commission shall
promote economic opportunity and competition . . . by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and
by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.131 One of the principal
means by which the Commission fulfills these mandates is through the award of bidding credits to small
businesses.
        49. The Commission has stated that it would define eligibility requirements for small businesses
on a service-specific basis, taking into account the capital requirements and other characteristics of each
particular service in establishing the appropriate threshold.132 Although it has standardized many of its
auction rules, the Commission has determined that it will continue a service-by-service approach to
defining small businesses.133
        50. The Commissions experience with numerous auctions has demonstrated that bidding credits
for designated entities afford such entities substantial opportunity to compete with larger businesses for
spectrum licenses and provide spectrum-based services.134 In adopting size standards for auctions of
Cellular licenses covering RSAs, the Commission noted that the markets at issue could attract a wide
range of entities and therefore decided to establish three small business definitions and associated levels

of bidding credits.135 Two of the definitions the Commission adopted for Cellular RSA licenses, average
annual gross revenues not exceeding $40 million and average annual gross revenues not exceeding $15
million, were consistent with the small business definitions it had established for the PCS C and F blocks,
based on similarities between PCS and Cellular service.136 Because the Cellular RSAs were relatively
small rural markets, however, the Commission decided that smaller businesses might be interested in
acquiring licenses to provide service in such markets and could benefit from bidding credits. For this reason
the Commission adopted a third small business definition for Cellular RSA licenses, for entities with
average annual gross revenues not exceeding $3 million.137
         51. We believe the same reasoning applies to the Cellular Overlay Licenses to be offered under our
transition proposal. Accordingly, we propose to employ the following three small business definitions for
auctions of these licenses. We seek comment on whether we should define an entrepreneur as an entity
with average gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million, a small business as
an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15 million, and a very
small business as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $3
million. As provided in section 1.2110(f)(2) of our rules, we seek comment on whether we should offer
entrepreneurs a bidding credit of 15 percent, small businesses a bidding credit of 25 percent, and very
small businesses a bidding credit of 35 percent.138 Commenters are encouraged to provide feedback on the
costs and benefits of these proposed definitions and bidding credit designations. We also invite input on
whether alternative size standards should be established in light of the particular circumstances or
requirements that may apply to the proposed Cellular Overlay Licenses. Commenters advocating
alternatives should explain the basis for their proposed alternatives, including whether anything about the
characteristics or capital requirements of providing Cellular service or other considerations require a
different approach, as well as the costs and benefits of the alternatives.
           E.       Gulf of Mexico Service Area
         52. Cellular service in the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) (CMA Blocks 306A and 306B)
is subject to special licensing rules. The GMSA is divided by rule into two zones: the Coastal Zone
(GMCZ) in the Eastern Gulf region and the Exclusive Zone (GMEZ).139 Broadpoint, Inc. (Broadpoint), a
GMSA operator, raises concerns about changing the rules for the GMEZ.140 While Broadpoint limits its

comments to the GMEZ, CTIA asserts in its Revised Plan that the entire GMSA should be exempted from
any Cellular licensing transition.141
         53. The existing Cellular licensing regime for the GMSA was carefully developed by the
Commission after taking into account many prior disputes between Gulf-based and adjacent land-based
carriers, multiple prior Commission decisions, court litigation and judicial rulings,142 as well as the unique
circumstances of providing Cellular service in the Gulf region. We propose not to alter the existing
regime, except that we propose to subject GMSA licensees to our proposed field strength limit, discussed
below. We also believe that GMSA licensees may benefit from certain other rule changes proposed in
this NPRM. We seek comment on our proposed exemption of the GMSA from a Cellular licensing
transition at this time, including comment on which (if any) individual rule changes should be applied to
GMSA licensees.
           F.       Signal Field Strength Limit Proposal
          54. We agree with commenters that support subjecting Cellular licensees to a signal field strength
limit at their respective license boundaries.143 We believe that a median field strength limit of 40
dBµV/m is appropriate and propose that all Cellular licensees be subject to this limit in all CMA Blocks.
With an established field strength limit applicable to all Cellular licensees, the current rule governing
Service Area Boundary (SAB) extensions would be unnecessary, even in those CMA Blocks that remain
subject to the current site-based licensing rules for Unserved Area.144 In the latter class of CMA Blocks,
however, SABs and CGSAs (for new systems and expansions of existing systems) would still be
calculated under the provisions currently set forth in section 22.911.145 We seek comment on our
proposal.
         55. An appropriate field strength limit allows a licensee to transmit at a signal strength sufficient
to provide reliable service right up to the license boundary, while preventing the licensee from
transmitting at a signal strength that is excessive for that purpose. Having a 47 dBµV/m field strength
limit for PCS, for example, has worked effectively as a limit on the amount of signal incursion a licensee
may have into an adjacent licensed area, and we believe that a 40 dBµV/m field strength limit will be
similarly effective for the Cellular Service.146 While we recognize that 40 dBµV/m represents a stronger

   47 C.F.R. § 22.912. Licensees in the GMEZ (see id. § 22.912(b)(2)) may need to account for any differences in
calculation methodology necessitated by the over-water portion of the path (or use actual measurements). Our
proposed field strength limit would not be used to determine service coverage and would not replace the formula in
47 C.F.R. § 22.911 for site-based applications in CMA Blocks that continue to be governed by the existing rules (not
included in the Stage I auction).
145
      47 C.F.R. § 22.911.
146
    The field strength limit we are proposing for the Cellular Service appears on its face to be lower than the existing
broadband PCS field strength limit, yet it is comparable in effect. This is because the Cellular frequency
(~ 880 MHz) is lower than the PCS frequency (~ 1950 MHz), and consequently, the wavelength of a Cellular wave
is approximately 2.2 times larger than that of a broadband PCS wave. The difference in wavelength means that the
physical capture area of a Cellular antenna is approximately 2.2² = 4.8 times larger than that of an equivalent gain
PCS antenna. In decibels, this ratio is calculated as follows: 20 × log (1950 ÷ 880) = 6.9 dB, which rounds to 7 dB.
Thus, assuming equivalent gain antennas, a field strength of 40 dBuV/m at 880 MHz produces the same power at the
receiver input terminal (− 96 dBm, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna ) as does a field strength of 47 dBuV/m at
1950 MHz.

field strength compared to 32 dBµV/m, we do not anticipate a notable increase in boundary disputes if we
adopt our proposal. There is no evidence of a causal relationship between boundary disputes and a field
strength limit if the limit applies equally to all licensees in a given service.147 In cases where adjacent
Cellular licensees have a contractual agreement in place today, median field strength could already be
higher than 32 dBµV/m, and indeed could already be higher than 40 dBµV/m.
          56. We believe that co-channel licensees are themselves in the best position to negotiate the
placement and parameters of facilities near the boundary of another licensees protected area, taking into
account the factors unique to their systems and the area involved, including, for example, technologies,
traffic loading, topography, and location of major roads. Thus, consistent with the PCS field strength
limit rules,148 we also propose to allow Cellular licensees to negotiate contractual agreements specifying
field strength limits different from the limit established by rule.149
         57. Even with full compliance with the proposed field strength limit, licensees operating in
proximity to each other will still need to coordinate channel usage in order to avoid mutually destructive
interference. Section 22.907 of our rules requires that interference problems (and any possible problems
with traffic capture)150 in the Cellular Service be avoided by coordination between or among licensees,
e.g., through channel choice, sectors, codes, site locations, antenna patterns, and azimuths. Section
22.907 is technology-neutral and has been successful thus far in preventing an excessive quantity of
interference complaints from Cellular licensees. Therefore, we propose to retain the requirements for
mandatory coordination that are currently set forth in section 22.907.151
         58. We encourage parties to address all aspects of our proposal concerning a field strength limit
and continued mandatory licensee coordination. Interested parties that offer a counter-proposal, whether
for a different field strength limit or non-use of any signal field strength limit, should be specific and
explain how their proposal better serves the public interest, including whether it would be more cost
effective.
           G.       Other Alternatives to the Commissions Proposed Transition
         59. Single-stage Transition for All Blocks. We seek comment on the possibility of eliminating
the site-based licensing scheme and transitioning expeditiously, via a single auction, all CMA Blocks to a
geographic-based model. Commenters should address the impact of such a proposal on rural service and
rural interests in particular, given that once an Overlay License is offered at auction, the Unserved Area in
that particular Block would no longer be available under site-based licensing, even if the Overlay License
(Continued from previous page)
147
    There have been very few boundary disputes among PCS licensees, for example, which are subject to a field
strength limit of 47 dBµV/m at their respective license boundaries. Moreover, as PCS rules also permit negotiated
departures from the applicable limit, PCS licensees may be operating with field strength limits that exceed 47
dBµV/m.
148
      See 47 C.F.R. § 24.236.
149
    While licensees would be free under our proposal to negotiate a different field strength limit from the limit that is
ultimately adopted in this proceeding, we emphasize that Commission rules do not allow licensees to agree to
transmit their signals at a power level that is higher than the applicable power limit set forth in the rules.
150
    Traffic capture has not been a problem in Cellular digital systems (or in PCS systems) because of seamless
national coverage using the various technologies available today. With Cellular analog systems, issues with traffic
capture could arise because of relative differences between the signal levels of the home system and the roaming
system (and roamers might be charged higher rates). So long as the same signal level applies to all systems,
traffic capture concerns generally do not arise.

returns to the Commission for re-licensing. For example, if there is no successful bidder at auction, or if a
successful bidder is awarded the Overlay License but then, years later, fails to renew, the only
methodology for re-licensing is to offer the Overlay License again at a subsequent Commission auction.
We seek comment on these considerations under this alternate approach.
         60. A Three-Stage Transition. As another alternative, we could subdivide the Blocks that do not
now meet the Substantially Licensed test into two groups, as there may be some markets that need even
more time, such as those in Alaska and other very rural areas with similar construction challenges,
resulting in a third stage in the Cellular licensing transition. We seek specific comment on this approach
as well. For example, what benchmarks should be used to distinguish the Stage II Blocks from the Stage
III Blocks, and what is the basis for choosing such benchmarks? What would be an appropriate dividing
line in terms of licensed area? What should the trigger dates be for Stage II and Stage III, and what would
be the rationale? We also seek comment on whether all Blocks with unique construction challenges
should be subject to an extended build-out requirement while they remain under the site-based licensing
regime.
         61. Other Alternatives. We also welcome submission of alternatives that we have not considered
herein. Commenters who oppose our two-stage proposal and advocate an alternative need to address
details of implementation and should demonstrate how their alternative serves the public interest and is
cost effective.
           H.       Proposed Amendments to Rules and Possible Rule Relocation
                    1.       Proposed Amendments
                             a.        Transition-related Amendments
         62. Proposed new and revised rules to reflect the proposed two-stage transition of Cellular
licensing are set forth in Appendix E (Rules Appendix). We urge all parties to review the Rules
Appendix closely and submit detailed comments. Our proposals introduce some new terminology,
including for incumbent operations, and we also propose revisions and some deletions regarding the
definitions in rule section 22.99.152
                             b.        AMPS-related Data Collection; Other Deletions and Updates
         63. Although we are not proposing immediate fundamental changes to the rules for CMA Blocks
that are not to be included in the Stage I transition (except for the proposed establishment of a signal field
strength limit), we have reviewed all the Subpart H rules as well as certain Part 1 rules applicable to
Cellular licensing in an effort to streamline or update them, and we propose certain changes.153 We have
also reviewed these rules to determine whether any should be deleted as obsolete or, going forward, no
longer necessary. For example, we believe that certain items required under sections 22.929154 and
22.953(a)155 will no longer be routinely of interest to the Commissions engineering staff in their review
of Cellular applications in the future,156 and accordingly, we propose to streamline these requirements in a

revised section 22.953 (and a corresponding deletion of section 22.929). In addition, with sunset of the
requirement to provide analog Cellular service, all of section 22.901(b)157 has been rendered moot
(discussed further below) and we therefore propose to delete it.158 The results of our review are reflected
in the proposed rules set forth in the Rules Appendix. We invite all commenters to review each of the
proposed revisions and deletions and comment on them with specificity. If there are other rules that
commenters believe should be revised or deleted as part of our effort to streamline and update the rules
that govern Cellular licensees, we welcome suggestions regarding such revisions. Commenters should be
specific in their proposals, providing proposed language for the rule itself as well as the rationale for the
change.
         64. AMPS Sunset Certifications: Termination of Collection; Deletion of Section 22.901(b). On
June 15, 2007, the Commission released an Order declining to extend the sunset of the Cellular analog
service requirement set forth in section 22.901(b) of our rules.159 Pursuant to the 2007 AMPS Sunset
Order, on November 16, 2007, the Bureau released a Public Notice with instructions for Cellular
licensees on how to file a one-time Cellular Coverage Certification (AMPS Sunset Certification), which
would certify that discontinuance of analog service would not result in any loss of wireless coverage
throughout the CGSA.160 By filing an AMPS Sunset Certification, licensees could preserve the rights
associated with their previously determined CGSAs on file with the Commission as of the AMPS Sunset
Certifications filing date.161 The overwhelming majority of Cellular licensees have opted to file an
AMPS Sunset Certification. We believe that all Cellular licensees have had ample time—more than four
years since the AMPS Instructions Notice—to make their choice and file either the one-time AMPS
Sunset Certification or the appropriate revised CGSA showing.162 Accordingly, we propose to terminate

date). See 2007 AMPS Sunset Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 11267. We reiterate that it is a licensees obligation to file the
appropriate modification application seeking approval of any changes to the CGSA, including changes that may
have resulted from a switch from analog to digital operations. We also reiterate that licensees have had ample
opportunity since the AMPS Instructions Notice was released in November 2007 to file applications concerning
CGSA changes resulting from the cessation of analog operations.
162
  A Cellular licensee could also opt to make no filing if, in transitioning from analog to digital technology, there
was no effect on its CGSA-defining location, power, or height parameters. See 2007 AMPS Sunset Order, 22 FCC
Rcd at 11267.

comment on these proposals.
                    2.        Possible Relocation of Part 22 Cellular and Part 24 PCS Rules to Part 27
        65. In light of our proposal to revise the Cellular licensing rules to bring them in line with the
more flexible rules that govern other wireless services, we take this opportunity to invite comment on
placement of revised rules that may ultimately be adopted in this proceeding. Specifically, in the event
that we adopt a geographic area regime that includes Overlay Licenses, should the new Cellular rules be
incorporated into Part 27, which houses the existing rules for certain other flexible wireless services, such
as AWS, rather than in Subpart H of Part 22? If the revised Cellular rules are to be incorporated into Part
27, we believe that the rules for Part 24 PCS—which is already a flexible service governed by geographic
area-based licensing—should then also be moved into Part 27. Should the Commission initiate a separate
rulemaking to revise the Part 27 rules and reserve the possible relocation of Cellular and PCS rules to that
separate proceeding? We welcome comment on such relocations and the optimal timing for them.
                    3.        Proposed Correction of Section 1.958(d)
        66. We take this opportunity to propose correction of a clerical error in the distance computation
formula in section 1.958(d) of our rules.164 The error was introduced in the process of moving the
provision containing the formula from Part 22 (section 22.157) to Subpart F of Part 1.165 The proposed
correction is included in the Rules Appendix of this NPRM.

  impose an immediate freeze on the acceptance of certain Cellular applications.167 We recognize that the
  imposition of a freeze imposes costs for a limited period on some licensees, e.g., those that have already
  undertaken preparation of applications to change their system parameters or establish new systems.
  Rather than imposing a freeze on all modification and new-system applications, we are tailoring the
  freeze in this proceeding to: (1) provide for the continued expansion of service to consumers during the
  pendency of this proceeding; and (2) help the Commission identify Unserved Area and inform potential
  bidders of encumbrances well in advance of the auction. A tailored freeze will facilitate much needed
  network changes. We conclude that the benefits described above outweigh the limited potential costs of
  this tailored freeze. In addition, consistent with our actions in numerous prior proceedings,168 by this
  Order we adopt other interim procedures for certain Cellular applications, as explained below.169
           68. We recognize that licensees in the Cellular Service, with approximately three decades of
  deployment, have demonstrated levels of service in excess of other commercial wireless services. We
  seek to allow licensees to continue limited expansion of existing systems necessary to respond to
  customer needs by addressing technical changes at the periphery of their current CGSAs without facing
  strike applications, i.e., applications filed primarily to block such service during a transition to
  geographic area licensing.170 Moreover, accepting and processing all applications in the normal course
  under our current rules would arguably be inconsistent with our goal of changing to a less burdensome
  licensing system.171
         69. Accordingly, as of the adoption date of this Order (Adoption Date) and until further notice,
  we hereby suspend acceptance of certain Cellular applications claiming Unserved Area in Covered
  CMA Blocks. Covered Blocks include: (i) those we preliminarily determine to be Substantially
  Licensed under either benchmark of our proposed test (listed in Appendix C); and (ii) those we

?                                     Federal Communications Commission                                    FCC 12-20


  preliminarily determine to be more than 90% but less than 95% licensed (listed in Appendix F).172 In
  Covered Blocks, we prohibit the filing of applications for: (a) new-system Cellular licenses; and (b)
  major modifications to expand existing systems if claiming Unserved Area that is not contiguous to the
  existing CGSA. The prohibition applies even if a portion of the area to be claimed as CGSA lies in a
  non-Covered Block.173 Any applications prohibited under this Order that are received on or after the
  Adoption Date are to be dismissed by the Bureau as unacceptable for filing.
           70. We will permit major modification applications that propose CGSA expansion in, or into,
  Covered Blocks only if claiming Unserved Area that is contiguous to the existing CGSA.174 Also, as of
  the Adoption Date and until further notice, we will use a same-day filing group for purposes of
  determining mutual exclusivity of permissible Cellular applications that entail Unserved Area in
  Covered Blocks. We will dismiss any mutually exclusive applications claiming Unserved Area in
  Covered Blocks that are received on or after the Adoption Date rather than conduct closed auctions to
  resolve such applications. We will permit major amendments to permissible major modification
  applications only so long as the proposed CGSA expansion in the amendment is claiming Unserved
  Area that is contiguous175 to the existing licensed CGSA. Also, for such major amendments filed on or
  after the Adoption Date and until further notice, we will use a same-day filing group for purposes of
  determining mutual exclusivity, and we will dismiss any such mutually exclusive major amendments
  rather than conduct closed auctions to resolve them.
          71. These interim filing procedures do not affect applications claiming Unserved Area solely in
  non-Covered CMA Blocks, which we will continue to accept and process under current rules and
  procedures, nor do they affect any applications that do not propose a new Cellular system or a CGSA
  expansion (e.g., renewals, transfers, assignments, modifications that do not extend a CGSA boundary,
  administrative updates, and required notifications), no matter the Block.176 We advise all parties,
  however, that although minor modification applications (regardless of market) are not affected by the
  freeze we impose under this Order, we know from experience that staff might find on review that a
  purported minor modification application submitted on or after the Adoption Date is in fact a major
  modification application. If such an application is for Unserved Area (in whole or in part) in a Covered
  CMA Block, the application will be subject to the same procedures and restrictions described above
  (including dismissal if an impermissible filing under this Order).
          72. As the Commission has previously stated, a freeze is a necessary adjunct to any efficient
  and effective rule making until the current rules can be reexamined and in which amendments to the
  rules might be made.177 In sum, we find that the public interest is best served by imposition of the

172
   We have not listed in this Appendix the Blocks already listed in Appendix C (i.e., those that preliminarily meet
either benchmark of our proposed Substantially Licensed test), which are also Covered Blocks for purposes of this
Order.
173
   Thus, for example, if a proposed new-system or major modification application proposes to claim (as CGSA)
Unserved Area that straddles a CMA boundary, where the CMA Block on one side of the boundary is Covered
while the Block on the other side of the boundary is non-Covered, the entire application will be treated as if solely
for Unserved Area in a Covered Block.
174
   If an application proposes to claim (as CGSA) contiguous Unserved Area that is partially in a Covered Block and
partially in a non-Covered Block, the application will be treated as if the entire claimed area is in a Covered Block.

  freeze and related interim procedures we adopt today. In the following Section B, we discuss how we
  will process currently pending new-system and CGSA-expansion applications in Covered CMA Blocks.
            B.          Currently Pending Non-Mutually Exclusive Applications in Covered CMA Blocks
           73. New-System and Major Modification Applications. Currently pending applications (i.e.,
  filed prior to the Adoption Date) that propose either a new Cellular system or a modification that would
  expand an existing systems CGSA boundary in, or into, Covered CMA Blocks fall into one of two
  categories: (1) those accepted for filing and placed on public notice at least 30 days before the
  Adoption Date; and (2) those for which the 30-day public comment period has not yet expired as of the
  Adoption Date. We will treat non-mutually exclusive applications in the first category (including
  pending applications that would be impermissible under this Order if filed on or after the Adoption
  Date) under existing rules and will process them in the normal course as expeditiously as possible,
  subject to certain interim procedures regarding major amendments. Specifically, for pending
  modification applications proposing expansion of an existing CGSA, we will permit major amendments
  on or after the Adoption Date subject to the same interim procedures described above in Section
  IV.A.178 For pending new-system applications, we will permit major amendments on or after the
  Adoption Date only so long as the proposed new-system CGSA in the amendment is claiming Unserved
  Area that is contiguous to the CGSA proposed in the application that was pending as of the Adoption
  Date.179 For such amendments, we will use a same-day filing group for purposes of determining
  mutual exclusivity, and we will dismiss any such mutually exclusive major amendments claiming
  Unserved Area in Covered Blocks that are received on or after the Adoption Date rather than conduct
  closed auctions to resolve them. On balance, rather than holding the applications in abeyance until
  conclusion of this proceeding, we conclude that processing pending applications in the first category
  under existing rules, subject to the interim procedures described herein, will not sacrifice the goals we
  seek to accomplish in this proceeding.180
           74. Pending new-system and major modification applications in the second category (i.e., filed
  prior to the Adoption Date but for which the 30-day comment period has not expired) claiming any
  Unserved Area in Covered CMA Blocks will be deemed mutually exclusive only if a competing
  application was filed prior to the Adoption Date of this Order. Applications in the second category that
  are not mutually exclusive will be processed under our current rules, except that we will only permit the
  filing of major amendments subject to the same interim procedures described above regarding major
  amendments to applications in the first category.
           75. Minor Modifications. As explained above, applications submitted as minor modifications
  of an existing CGSA are sometimes found by staff to be major modification applications. During the
  pendency of this proceeding, a minor modification application submitted prior to the Adoption Date
  that is determined to be proposing a major modification claiming (as CGSA) Unserved Area in a
  Covered Block will be treated the same as a pending major modification application in accordance with
  the interim procedures described above.



178
      See supra ¶ 70.
179
   If an application proposes to claim (as CGSA) contiguous Unserved Area that is partially in a Covered Block and
partially in a non-Covered Block, the application will be treated as if the entire claimed area is in a Covered Block.

V.          PROCEDURAL MATTERS
            A.       Ex Parte Rules – Permit-But-Disclose
         76. The proceeding this NPRM initiates shall be treated as a permit-but-disclose proceeding in
accordance with the Commissions ex parte rules.181 Persons making ex parte presentations must file a
copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within two
business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the Sunshine period applies).
Persons making oral ex parte presentations are reminded that memoranda summarizing the presentation
must (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting at which the ex parte
presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made during the
presentation. If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or arguments
already reflected in the presenters written comments, memoranda or other filings in the proceeding, the
presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, memoranda, or
other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be
found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum. Documents shown or given to Commission
staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must be filed
consistent with section 1.1206(b).182 In proceedings governed by section 1.49(f)183 or for which the
Commission has made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and
memoranda summarizing oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through
the electronic comment filing system available for that proceeding, and must be filed in their native
format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt, searchable .pdf). Participants in this proceeding should familiarize
themselves with the Commissions ex parte rules.
            B.       Comment Period and Procedures

          79. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA),186 the Commission has
prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant economic impact on
small entities of the policies and rules proposed in the NPRM. The analysis is found in Appendix G. We
request written public comment on the analysis. Comments must be filed by the same dates as listed on
the first page of this document and must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as
responses to the IRFA. The Commissions Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, Reference
Information Center, will send a copy of this Notice, including the IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.
           D.       Initial Paperwork Reduction Analysis
        80. This document contains proposed new and modified information collection requirements.
The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public
and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to comment on the information collection
requirements contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public
Law 104-13. In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-
198, see 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4), we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the
information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.

compliance with the construction requirement. See § 1.946 of this chapter. See also § 22.953.
    (c) Failure to meet the requirements in this section by the deadline will result in automatic
termination of the authorization and such licensee will be ineligible to regain it.
Revise Section 22.948 in its entirety to read as follows:
§ 22.948 Geographic partitioning and spectrum disaggregation.
    Cellular licensees may apply to partition their cellular licensed area or to disaggregate their licensed
spectrum at any time following the grant of their authorization(s). Parties seeking approval for
partitioning and disaggregation shall request from the FCC an authorization for partial assignment of a
license pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter. See also paragraph (f) of this § 22.948.
   (a) Partitioning. Applicants must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to § 1.948 of this chapter. The filing
must include the attachments required under § 22.953, including GIS map files and a reduced-size PDF
map, for both the assignor and the assignee.
     (1) Within a CMA Block that has not yet been included in an auction under § 22.985, partitioning of
a CGSA must be on a site-by-site basis; i.e., the partitioned area must comprise only the area resulting
from one or more cell sites pursuant to § 22.911. At least one entire cell site must be partitioned. If all
cell sites are assigned, it is not partitioning, but rather a full assignment of authorization.
    (2) Partitioning of the licensed area of a cellular area-based authorization (including, e.g., the
licensed area of a Cellular Overlay Authorization) to a licensee in a CMA Block that has not yet been
included in an auction under § 22.985 must be on a site-by-site basis; i.e., the partitioned area must
comprise CGSA resulting from one or more cell sites pursuant to § 22.911.
    (3) Partitioning of the licensed area of a cellular area-based authorization within the same CMA
Block that has been included in an auction under § 22.985, or to a licensee in another CMA Block that has
also been included in such an auction (including, e.g., the partitioning of a Cellular Overlay
Authorization area by one Cellular Overlay Licensee to another Cellular Overlay Licensee), may involve
any proportion of division. If all of the licensed area is assigned, it is not partitioning, but rather a full
assignment of authorization.
    (b) Disaggregation. Spectrum may be disaggregated in any amount.
    (c) Combined partitioning and disaggregation. The FCC will consider requests for partial
assignment of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.
    (d) Field strength limit. For purposes of partitioning and disaggregation, cellular systems must be
designed so as not to exceed a median field strength level of 40 dBµV/m at or beyond the boundary of the
Cellular Licensed Area, unless all affected adjacent service area licensees agree to a different signal
level. See § 22.983.
    (e) License term. The license term for a partitioned license area and for disaggregated spectrum will
be the remainder of the original license term.
     (f) Spectrum Leasing. Cellular spectrum leasing is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)
through (a)(3), (b) and (c) of this § 22.948, except that applicants must file FCC Form 608 (not FCC
Form 603), as well as all applicable provisions of subpart X of part 1 of this chapter.

Revise Section 22.949 in its entirety to read as follows:

§ 22.949 Unserved Area licensing process for site-based systems.
    This section sets forth the process for licensing Unserved Area in CMA Blocks not yet included in an
auction pursuant to § 22.985. The licensing process in this § 22.949 allows eligible parties to apply for
any Unserved Area that remains in such CMA Blocks.
    (a) The Unserved Area licensing process described in this section is on-going and applications may
be filed at any time, until the CMA Block is included in an auction pursuant to § 22.985.
    (b) There is no limit to the number of Unserved Area applications that may be granted on each CMA
Channel Block that remains subject to the procedures of this section. Consequently, such Unserved Area
applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Mutually exclusive
applications are processed using the general procedures in § 22.131. See also § 22.961.
  (c) Unserved Area applications under this section may propose a CGSA covering more than one
CMA. Each such Unserved Area application must request authorization for only one CGSA.
     (d) Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications for
Unserved Area (partial settlements) under this section are prohibited. Settlements among all applicants
with mutually exclusive applications under this section (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no
later than the date that the FCC Form 175 (short-form) is filed.

                                               APPENDIX G

                                   Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


         1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the Commission
has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in this Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). Written public comments are requested on this IRFA. Comments must
be filed by the same dates as listed on the first page of the NPRM and must have a separate and distinct
heading designating them as responses to this IRFA. The Commission will send a copy of the NPRM,
including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2 In
addition, the NPRM and IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3

           A.       Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules

        2. In the NPRM, the Commission proposes a transition for the 800 MHz Cellular (Cellular)
Service from site-based licensing to geographic-area licensing. The proposed transition would occur in
two stages, via Commission auction. We believe that the current site-based paradigm is outdated and
hinders carriers from being able to respond quickly to changing market conditions and consumer
demands. We also believe it is contrary to the public interest to maintain a burdensome system to
preserve extremely limited Unserved Area licensing opportunities. The Commissions early key goal of
creating a seamless and integrated nationwide Cellular Service has been achieved throughout the vast
majority of our nation. The Commission has long held that market-based licensing regimes are simpler to
administer for all parties concerned. The proposed transition would reduce administrative burdens for
licensees as well as Commission staff. The proposed transition is consistent with the Commissions
ongoing regulatory reform agenda and also supports the Commissions Data Innovation Initiative,
launched in June 2010, by reducing information collection burdens under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
We anticipate that, with the proposed additional flexibility provided to licensees, the regulatory and
compliance costs associated with service provision would be reduced. These changes would also put
Cellular licensees more on par with other wireless telecommunications licensees and further the
Commissions goal of rule harmonization for the different wireless services.

        3. As detailed in Section III, we propose a transition in two stages. Consistent with precedent,
we would accept competing applications for Overlay Licenses, and resolve them via auction, for each
CMA Block.4 In Stage I, the Commission would offer Overlay Licenses for all CMA Blocks that are
Substantially Licensed or authorized solely under interim operating authority (IOA). We propose the
following test to determine if a CMA Block is Substantially Licensed: either (1) at least 95% of the total
land area in the CMA Block is licensed; or (2) there is no parcel within the Block at least 50 contiguous
square miles in size that is not licensed. We believe it is appropriate to include total land area without
exclusions in calculating the licensed area. If a CMA Block meets either benchmark as of an established

    As explained in the NPRM, each CMA has two channel Blocks: A and B.


                                                      77
?                                  Federal Communications Commission                               FCC 12-20


date, it would be deemed Substantially Licensed and included in the Stage I transition. We propose,
however, that the Gulf of Mexico Service Area (GMSA) be exempt from the transition because it is
governed by a specialized licensing regime.

         4. All CMA Blocks that do not meet the Substantially Licensed test would remain under site-
based licensing until Stage II is triggered. In Stage II, the Commission proposes to offer Overlay
Licenses for all remaining CMA Blocks (except the GMSA), regardless of the percentage of total land
area licensed, and terminate site-based licensing. In the NPRM, we propose to continue the site-based
model for seven years before Stage II is triggered, and we seek comment on whether this is the
appropriate period of time. We believe that the public interest is best served by preserving the current
schemes direct spectrum access through site-based applications in Blocks that are not yet Substantially
Licensed, primarily rural areas out west, for a defined period of time. This will allow all interested parties
to have the opportunity to identify the specific areas they wish to serve as demographics change or service
otherwise becomes economically feasible in such markets. Moreover, site-based licensing in such Blocks
will ensure build-out within one year of authorization of such areas.

        5. Overlay Licensees would be obligated to protect incumbent licensees operations from
harmful interference. That obligation would cease with respect to any incumbents licensed area
relinquished for any reason in the future (e.g., through failure to renew the license). Such relinquished
areas would not be returned to the Commissions auction inventory but, rather, could by served
immediately by the Overlay Licensee on a primary basis without being subject to competitive bidding.

         6. The Chambers, Texas Block-A market (Chambers) is the only CMA Block for which a
license has never been issued; the market is served solely under IOA. We propose to include Chambers
in the Stage I auction and award an Overlay License consistent with the process described for the
Substantially Licensed Blocks, but subject to specific build-out requirements for the Chambers Overlay
Licensee, as explained in Section III.A.2. We believe this is the most efficient and effective way to
resolve the continued lack of a licensee and help bring additional advanced service to this Texas market.

         7. We also propose that all Cellular licensees, regardless of Block, should be subject to a field
strength limit at their respective license boundaries, similar to licensees in other flexible services such as
PCS, certain AWS, etc. The NPRM proposes a median field strength limit of 40 dBµV/m for the Cellular
Service. We also propose certain other revisions in individual Cellular rules to reflect the proposed
transition, and to delete provisions that we deem obsolete or unnecessary going forward, including certain
application requirements and other filings, and to streamline certain other provisions. The proposed rules
are set forth in Appendix E and we encourage all interested parties to review them carefully. We seek
comment on how the proposals will impact the amount of information available to regulated entities and
the public.

        B.      Legal Basis

        8. The proposed action is taken under Sections 1, 2, 4(i), 301, 303, 307, 309, 319, 324, and 332
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 152, 154(i), 301, 303, 307, 309, 319,
324, and 332.

        C.      Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities To Which the Proposed
                Rules Will Apply

        9. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the
number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.5 The RFA generally
defines the term small entity as having the same meaning as the terms small business, small
organization, and small governmental jurisdiction.6 In addition, the term small business has the
same meaning as the term small business concern under the Small Business Act.7 A small business
concern is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.8
         10. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, and Small Governmental Jurisdictions. Our action
may, over time, affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. We therefore describe here,
at the outset, three comprehensive, statutory small entity size standards.9 First, nationwide, there are a
total of approximately 27.5 million small businesses, according to the SBA.10 In addition, a small
organization is generally any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and
is not dominant in its field.11 Nationwide, as of 2007, there were approximately 1,621,315 small
organizations.12 Finally, the term small governmental jurisdiction is defined generally as governments
of cities, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than
fifty thousand.13 Census Bureau data for 2011 indicate that there were 89,476 local governmental
jurisdictions in the United States.14 We estimate that, of this total, as many as 88,506 entities may qualify
as small governmental jurisdictions.15 Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are

  5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of small business concern in 15 U.S.C. § 632).
Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies unless an agency, after consultation with the
Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or
more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in
the Federal Register. Id.

     U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES: 2011, Table 427 (2007).
15
  The 2007 U.S. Census data for small governmental organizations indicate that there were 89, 476 Local
Governments in 2007. (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES 2011,
Table 428). The criterion by which the size of such local governments is determined to be small is a population of
50,000. However, because the Census Bureau does not specifically apply that criterion, it cannot be determined with
precision how many of such local governmental organizations are small. Nonetheless, the inference seems
reasonable that a substantial number of these governmental organizations has a population of less than 50,000. To
look at Table 428 in conjunction with a related set of data in Table 429 in the Censuss Statistical Abstract of the
U.S., that inference is further supported by the fact that in both Tables, many entities that may well be small are
included in the 89,476 local governmental organizations, e.g., county, municipal, township and town, school district
and special district entities. Measured by a criterion of a population of 50,000, many specific sub-entities in this
category seem more likely than larger county-level governmental organizations to have small populations.

small.
         11. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). The appropriate size standard
under SBA rules is for the category Wireless Telecommunications Carriers. The size standard for that
category is that a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.16 Census Bureau data for 2007,
which now supersede data from the 2002 Census, show that there were 3,188 firms in this category that
operated for the entire year. Of this total, 3,144 had employment of 999 or fewer, and 44 firms had
employment of 1,000 employees or more. Thus, under this category and the associated small business
size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications carriers (except
satellite) are small entities that may be affected by our proposed action.17 The Commissions own data—
available on its Spectrum Dashboard—indicate that, as of February 9, 2012, there are 347 Cellular
licensees that will be affected by this NPRM.18 The Commission does not know how many of these
licensees are small, as the Commission does not collect that information for these types of entities.


          D.       Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
                   Requirements

        12. In the NPRM, the Commission seeks to reduce filing burdens and recordkeeping for all
Cellular licensees by changing from site-based to geographic area licensing. We propose that, in the
Blocks for which an Overlay License is offered, the CGSA boundaries of incumbents that do not become
Overlay Licensees would be permanently fixed insofar as such incumbents would not be permitted to
expand their CGSAs, except through contractual arrangements with other licensees. They would,
however, be free to modify their systems in response to market demands without Commission filings in
most cases, so long as the CGSA would not be changed as a result, and subject to any obligations we
impose on all Cellular licensees.

         13. Under our proposal, in most cases Overlay Licensees would be free as well to modify their
systems without Commission filings, thereby minimizing their regulatory burdens. In addition, while
Overlay Licensees would be obligated to protect incumbent licensees operations from harmful
interference, that obligation would cease with respect to any incumbents licensed area (CGSA) or portion
thereof that is relinquished for any reason in the future (e.g., through failure to renew the license). Such
relinquished areas would not be returned to the Commissions auction inventory but, rather, could be
served by the Overlay Licensee on a primary basis immediately, without being subject to competitive
bidding.

        14. Once an Overlay License is granted via auction for Chambers, we propose not to subject the
Licensee to the existing rules concerning the five-year build-out phase or the Phase I or Phase II license
application processes that have been applicable to other CMA Blocks. Instead, we propose that the

Chambers Overlay Licensee be required to demonstrate that it has built out a Cellular system that is
providing signal coverage and offering service over at least 35% of the geographic area of its license
authorization within four years of initial license grant and at least 70% of the geographic area of its
license authorization by the end of the license term, with failure to meet these build-out deadlines
resulting in automatic forfeiture of the license. We further propose that, after the build-out requirements
have been met, the Chambers Overlay Licensee should be subject to the same rules and obligations that
we apply to the other Overlay Licenses issued in Stage I of the transition. For example, we seek comment
in the NPRM on whether Overlay Licensees should be subject to performance requirements.

         15. The Commission also proposes that all Cellular licensees be subject to a field strength limit at
their respective license boundaries and that a median field strength limit of 40 dBµV/m is appropriate for
the Cellular Band. Coordination among co-channel licensees regarding channel usage will remain
essential in actually preventing harmful interference. We therefore propose to retain the current Cellular
Service rule mandating coordination in certain circumstances (section 22.907), but we also propose to
allow Cellular licensees to negotiate contractual agreements specifying different field strength limits.
This will provide licensees with additional flexibility in their operations.

         16. In this NPRM, we also propose various other changes in parts 1 and 22 of the Commissions
rules that apply to Cellular Service licensees. For example, we propose to streamline the application
requirements for site-based Unserved Area applications, notably section 22.953 (deleting certain technical
data requirements that, going forward, we believe will no longer be routinely necessary). We also
propose to delete obsolete and outdated provisions, such as those requiring certifications associated with
cessation of analog service, often referred to as the analog sunset. Here too, our proposals are
consistent with the Commissions regulatory reform agenda and its Data Innovation Initiative. The
proposed rules are set forth in Appendix E and we encourage all interested parties to review them
carefully and comment on them with specificity.

           E.       Steps Taken To Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and
                    Significant Alternatives Considered

         17. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business,
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following
four alternatives (among others): (1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements
or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification,
consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small
entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of
the rule, or any part thereof for small entities.19

         18. The NPRM discusses several alternatives to the proposed two-stage transition. These include,
for example, alternatives that would entail transition via auction in more than two stages as well as
possible exemption for certain extremely rural markets such as Alaskan markets and others with special
build-out challenges. The NPRM also discusses proposals put forth by industry stakeholders thus far in
this proceeding, including an approach that would not entail competitive bidding. The NPRM specifically
invites interested parties to comment on these various alternatives and to suggest other alternative
proposals. At this time, the Commission has not excluded any alternative proposal from its consideration,
but it would do so in this proceeding if the record indicates that a particular proposal would have a

significant and unjustifiable adverse economic impact on small entities.

         19. The Commission believes that the proposed transition to a geographic-area licensing system
for the Cellular Service in two stages via auction will benefit all Cellular incumbents and entrants,
regardless of size. The proposed scheme would put Cellular licensees on a regulatory par with other
wireless licensees that hold geographic area licenses, such as PCS and certain AWS licensees, thus easing
the regulatory burden of compliance by eliminating discrepancies in competing services. The
Commission has historically valued harmonization in the rules for wireless licensees by eliminating
burdensome requirements, as appropriate. Furthermore, we anticipate that the modernized licensing
scheme will encourage Cellular licensees to invest in and deploy ever more advanced technologies as they
evolve. By reducing the paperwork burden on Cellular providers, we would also expect their resulting
lower costs to have some positive effect on the rates paid by subscriber groups, including small
businesses that rely on Cellular service.

Re:     Amendment of Parts 1 and 22 of the Commissions Rules with Regard to the Cellular Service,
        Including Changes in Licensing of Unserved Area; Amendment of the Commissions Rules with
        Regard to Relocation of Part 24 to Part 2; Interim Restrictions and Procedures for Cellular Service
        Applications, WT Docket No. 12-40, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order (FCC 12-20).

       Today we take another important step in our work to reform the FCC, reduce unnecessary
administrative burdens, and increase regulatory parity. We are proposing to migrate the 800 MHz cellular
spectrum from a site-based to a geographic-based licensing system, which will reduce licensing and filing
burdens relating to use of the spectrum.

         The 800 MHz Cellular Radiotelephone Service is the band that spawned the mobile revolution
roughly 30 years ago, and its unique site-by-site licensing model helped bring mobile service to all
Americans, even in remote rural areas. But the original licensing model has outlived its original utility.
Its time to transition from the old site-based licensing model to a more flexible geographically-licensed
model.

        The new licensing model for 800 MHz will be the same as our more recent, flexibly licensed
bands, such as PCS, AWS, and the 700 MHz band.

        Well implement this with a two-stage transition using auctions of overlay licenses to ensure
efficiency and convey more flexible rights to license holders.

        The NPRM also proposes several changes to the Cellular rules to update or eliminate outdated
technical provisions and data collection requirements to reduce administrative burdens on licensees. This
item proposes to eliminate seven unnecessary data collections, which, if adopted, will bring to 32 the
number of unnecessary data collections we have eliminated.

        The Commissions actions to end these data collections – and eliminate more than 210
regulations – are consistent with two Executive Orders that called on federal agencies to review rules and
regulations and ensure they are cost-effective and dont place unnecessary burdens on industry.

       Im pleased to thank CTIA for its petition, which spurred this rulemaking, as well as NTCA, and
RTG – the Rural Telecommunications Group – for their comments and insight. We look forward to
comments from all interested parties to ensure the transition is a success.

          Thank you to the staff of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau for their hard work and
creative thinking on ways in which we can remove regulatory barriers, make more spectrum available for
critical services, and increase spectrum flexibility.

         Today we seek comment on a comprehensive proposal to make the Commissions cellular service
rules consistent with those of virtually all other commercial wireless services. Updating these rules will
offer greater flexibility to construct and operate facilities within a larger geographic area and commence
operations without prior Commission approval, thereby reducing regulatory requirements.

        Adopted decades ago, the current site-based cellular licensing rules are now obsolete and create
unnecessary burdens for both licensees and Commission staff. Given our aim to modernize and
streamline our licensing processes and to create parity among competing mobile providers, I am pleased
to support this notice and associated order.

The notice is detailed and broad in scope, setting forth an array of ideas. The order suspending certain
filings associated with cellular licensing will permit the orderly and effective resolution of the
fundamental changes and issues raised today. I thank the Chairman for bringing these matters forward, as
well as the talented team in the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau for your thoughtful, creative work.
I look forward to engaging with interested stakeholders to learn more about the pros and cons of this
proposal.

                             COMMISSIONER MIGNON L. CLYBURN


Re:     Amendment of Parts 1 and 22 of the Commissions Rules with Regard to the Cellular Service,
        Including Changes in Licensing of Unserved Area; Amendment of the Commissions Rules with
        Regard to Relocation of Part 24 to Part 2; Interim Restrictions and Procedures for Cellular Service
        Applications, WT Docket No. 12-40, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Order (FCC 12-20).

        Last July, President Obama issued an Executive Order directing independent agencies to identify,
and repeal or modify rules that are outmoded or excessively burdensome. Based on the record, thus far, I
agree that many of the site-based licensing rules of the 800 MHz Cellular Radiotelephone Service meet
the Executive Orders standard. When the FCC established the initial rules for allocating this cellular
service some thirty years ago, it adopted a hybrid licensing approach. Original Service Licensees were
given five years to build networks in any part of a geographic location. Any area, which was not built out
during that time period, was then relinquished, and the FCC would subsequently re-license those
unconstructed areas on a site-by-site basis. This licensing approach helped to drive construction of
mobile wireless networks across the nation.

         But now we find that many of the site-based rules in this cellular service have become outdated.
The existing technical rules for this service define a cellular carrier's service area based upon analog
signal propagation. As a result of the Commissions 2002 order, which established the sunset of analog
cellular service rules, analog service is generally no longer being offered. Therefore, it no longer makes
sense to define a cellular service area based on analog signals.

        Over the years, the Commission has also learned that there are a number of administrative costs
associated with site-based licensing. Under the current rules, a cellular licensee making any system
change, that would expand or decrease its service area, must file an application with comprehensive
engineering data. Geographic area licenses, especially when used in more metropolitan areas, obviate the
need for these numerous filings. Therefore, these licenses allow providers to more rapidly deploy and
modify facilities within their licensed areas. Of all the licensed services that providers use to offer
consumers commercial mobile wireless service, the 800 MHz Cellular Service is the only one that still
incorporates site-based licensing. So, eliminating site-based licensing rules, when they no longer make
sense, appropriately promotes more rapid network deployment and furthers regulatory parity.

          There are a number of important proposals in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, such as:
awarding Overlay Licenses through competitive bidding; allowing licensees to use secondary market
measures to spur deployment; and the use of bidding credits to encourage small businesses to enter the
mobile industry. I strongly encourage the industry and the public to carefully consider all of the proposals
in this item. I am particularly interested in hearing how these proposals, or any alternatives, could
promote more competitive options for consumers.

       I commend Rick Kaplan and his staff of the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau for their hard
work on this item.
